# The Best of Ruby Quiz (using Common Lisp)

About 15 years ago, the [Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com) used to be a popular thing.

Not so much anymore. :(

Pragprog released [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Ruby-Quiz-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/0976694077) featuring the 25 most popular quizzes,
but it is unfortunately no longer in print.

I've got an old copy and I'm using the challenges as an excuse
to play with Common Lisp.

None of the challenges are trivial, but nothing that you couldn't
do over a lunch break.

All examples developed using [sbcl](http://www.sbcl.org/) and [slime](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/)
unless otherwise noted.
